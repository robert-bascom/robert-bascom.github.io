'Personal History Timeline' is a custom-designed software application to help you log those week-to-week activities that form the tapestry of your life.

Keep track of those wonderful Anniversary dinners with a loved one, or those occasional weekend getaways and the funny, little things you found to buy. *What was the name of that shop?*

How about those fun birthday barbecues with friends and family. *Who* ***was*** *that girl that Tom was dating?*

What did the Vet say about nutrition during our last appointment? When did the warranty begin for Dad's new table saw. What elementary school was I attending when I won best prize for my Thanksgiving Poster?

Cherished memories, all. There is simply no other scrolling timeline software in the market to match this masterpiece for recording these special events and revisiting them again and again, as you grow older.

And because Linux Mint (and other Linux distributions) are rapidly replacing Windows as the operating system of choice on many home computers, this system is ready to install. It features a year-to-year sliding timeline that shows what happened that year; a powerful Search capability when you can't remember special dates; built-in tools to help you Add and Edit your data; and other tools to help you tag and categorize those personal memories any way you want. Finally, it comes with a test database to help you learn the ropes.

The price is reasonable. Pay once and the software is yours. No monthly payments; no recurring license fees. No hassle.
